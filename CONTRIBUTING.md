# Contributing to Eugene Code Camp

The Eugene Code Camp website is an open source project, and as such welcomes contributions from the community. Please make sure you read and agree to the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/EugeneCodeCamp/EugeneCodeCamp.github.io/blob/master/README.md) before getting involved.

This site is an ongoing project, currently being built in [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), using [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [Boostratp-vue](https://bootstrap-vue.js.org/), styled using the [Freelancer Theme from Start-Bootstrap](https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-freelancer).

## Getting Started

Please read the [README](https://github.com/EugeneCodeCamp/EugeneCodeCamp.github.io/blob/master/README.md) file to learn how to install the project.

The repo tasks are divided into 2 types, [projects](https://github.com/EugeneCodeCamp/EugeneCodeCamp.github.io/projects) and [one-off issues](https://github.com/EugeneCodeCamp/EugeneCodeCamp.github.io/issues).

### For Contributors with Write Access

If you are a direct contributor, you can make a direct push from a branch to the repo to make a pull request. To do this, go into your local clone and do
    $ git checkout -b issue-number

Do the work in this branch and then push it back for your pull request. The git prompts will assist you in this.

### For Others

If you do not have direct write access (which is generally only given to those who are regular contributors and/or local attendees), you can fork this repo into your own profile, and then submit a pull request back on the master branch.

### For those new to programming

You'll notice some of the issues have the [good first issue](https://github.com/EugeneCodeCamp/EugeneCodeCamp.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) label. These task are good to learn the basics of using github and making a pull request. If you need help with one of these issues, please make a comment in the issue to request help.

## Kind Pull Requests

The people approving and merging pull requests are here to help, but you can make it easier on them by making good pull requests. This includes:

1. Using a clear title for your pull request.
2. Giving a detailed description of the pull request.
3. Only including one issue per pull request.
4. Linking to that issue in your description.
5. Telling the reviewer, in the description, how this pull request might be tested.

Keep in mind that a pull request is not a guarantee of being merged, and it is also a learning opportunity for others to make comments and suggestions. Whether you are giving or receiving feedback, just remember that we are all learners so please be open-minded and kind!
